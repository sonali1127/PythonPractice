The requests module in Python is used to make HTTP requests, 
which means it allows your Python program to communicate with websites and web services over the internet.
What is an HTTP request?
When you visit a website, your browser sends a request to the website's server, asking for a page.
The server then responds with the webpage's content. This process follows the HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol). 
he requests module allows Python to do the same thing programmatically.
Why use requests?
To fetch data from a website (like downloading a webpage or API data).
To send data to a website (like submitting a form or logging in).
To interact with web services (like getting weather data, stock prices, etc.).
Common Types of Requests
1. GET Request – Used to request data from a website.
2. POST Request – Used to send data to a website.
3. PUT Request – Used to update existing data.
4. DELETE Request – Used to delete data.
